## **Task 2 ‚Äì Exploratory Data Analysis on Employee Dataset**  

### **Overview**  
This project is part of **Task 2** of my **Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology**.  
The goal was to perform **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the **Employee.csv** dataset to uncover **trends, patterns, and relationships** between variables.  

---

## **Dataset Description**  
The dataset contains employee information with the following columns:  

- **Company** ‚Äì Organization name (e.g., TCS, Infosys, Cognizant)  
- **Employee Age** ‚Äì Age of the employee  
- **Employee Salary** ‚Äì Salary of the employee (numeric)  
- **Place** ‚Äì City of work  
- **Country** ‚Äì Country of work (India)  
- **Gender** ‚Äì Male/Female  

---

## **Tools & Libraries Used**  
- **Pandas** ‚Äì Data cleaning & manipulation  
- **NumPy** ‚Äì Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib** ‚Äì Visualization  
- **Seaborn** ‚Äì Statistical plots  
- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì Interactive analysis  

---

## **Data Cleaning Process**  
- **Handled Missing Values** ‚Äì Filled or removed where necessary.  
- **Removed Duplicates** ‚Äì Eliminated repeated entries to ensure accuracy.  
- **Outlier Treatment** ‚Äì Applied the **IQR method** to detect and remove extreme salary/age values.  
- **Zero Age Correction** ‚Äì Replaced zero ages with **NaN** for proper handling.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis**  

The following analyses were conducted:  
- **Which company pays more on average**   
- **Does gender impact salary distribution**  
- **Which locations have more high-salary employees**  
- **Is there a correlation between age and salary**   

**Visualizations created include:**  
- Count plots for categorical variables  
- Boxplots for salary distribution by company and gender  
- Pie charts for employee distribution  
- Grouped bar plots (e.g., Gender split by Company)  
- Heatmap for numerical correlation

## **Key Insights**  
- **Company Salary Trends** ‚Äì Certain companies consistently offer higher salaries.  
- **Gender Salary Comparison** ‚Äì Slight differences observed between male and female salaries.  
- **Location Salary Trends** ‚Äì Some cities have a higher concentration of high-salary employees.  
- **Age-Salary Relationship** ‚Äì Weak positive correlation between age and salary.

## **Conclusion**  
This task provided **valuable insights** into employee demographics and salary patterns.  
The findings can help **HR teams** make **data-driven decisions** regarding pay structure, hiring strategies, and workforce planning.
