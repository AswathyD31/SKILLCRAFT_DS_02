## **Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis on Employee Dataset**  

### **Overview**  
This project is part of **Task 2** of my **Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology**.  
The goal was to perform **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the **Employee.csv** dataset to uncover **trends, patterns, and relationships** between variables.  

---

## **Dataset Description**  
The dataset contains employee information with the following columns:  

- **Company** – Organization name (e.g., TCS, Infosys, Cognizant)  
- **Employee Age** – Age of the employee  
- **Employee Salary** – Salary of the employee (numeric)  
- **Place** – City of work  
- **Country** – Country of work (India)  
- **Gender** – Male/Female  

---

## ** Tools & Libraries Used**  
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning & manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization  
- **Seaborn** – Statistical plots  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis  

---

## ** Data Cleaning Process**  
- **Handled Missing Values** – Filled or removed where necessary.  
- **Removed Duplicates** – Eliminated repeated entries to ensure accuracy.  
- **Outlier Treatment** – Applied the **IQR method** to detect and remove extreme salary/age values.  
- **Zero Age Correction** – Replaced zero ages with **NaN** for proper handling.

## ** Exploratory Data Analysis**  

The following analyses were conducted:  
- **Which company pays more on average** 📈  
- **Does gender impact salary distribution**  
- **Which locations have more high-salary employees** 🏙️  
- **Is there a correlation between age and salary** 📉  

**Visualizations created include:**  
- Count plots for categorical variables  
- Boxplots for salary distribution by company and gender  
- Pie charts for employee distribution  
- Grouped bar plots (e.g., Gender split by Company)  
- Heatmap for numerical correlation  

---

## ** Key Insights**  
- **Company Salary Trends** – Certain companies consistently offer higher salaries.  
- **Gender Salary Comparison** – Slight differences observed between male and female salaries.  
- **Location Salary Trends** – Some cities have a higher concentration of high-salary employees.  
- **Age-Salary Relationship** – Weak positive correlation between age and salary.  

---

## ** Conclusion**  
This task provided **valuable insights** into employee demographics and salary patterns.  
The findings can help **HR teams** make **data-driven decisions** regarding pay structure, hiring strategies, and workforce planning.
